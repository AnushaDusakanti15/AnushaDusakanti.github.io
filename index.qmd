## 

Hello, I am Anusha Dusakanti and welcome to my website.

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University.

My passion to learn about data and its applications, made me choose this course for my Masters. I am confident that my proficiency in Java, Python, AWS will aid me in completing this course and I am looking forward to learn about R and using it for data visualizations.
