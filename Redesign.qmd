Below is a redesigning project on which my classmate, Sumrah Shakeel and I worked on for the Applied Statistics & Visualization for Analytics (STAT515) class taken at George Mason University. This project involves us finding a bad graph and redesigning it to display meaningful visualizations.

The graph we selected to redesign is a line chart that shows the Unemployment Rate from 1968-2022 in Japan. The amount of information on this graph is quite a lot and the viewer can barely pinpoint the percentages mentioned here.

##### *Strengths: Easy to Identify Trends*

##### *Weakness: Cluttered, Overwhelming to the User, Difficult to Understand*

#### **Visualization 1:** Grouped Bar Chart for Youth Unemployment Rate during Employment Ice Age (1993-2004) in Japan

We redesigned the above graph as a bar chart, by considering the unemployment rate of youth(ages 15-24) during the Employment Ice Age period.

From the graph below it is evident that the unemployment rate has steadily increased during the Employment Ice Age period. For all the person, it peaked in 2003 at 10.16%, for men it peaked in 2003 at 11.56%, and for women it peaked in 2001 at 8.71%. In 1994, which was the beginning of the Ice Age, the unemployment rate was the lowest for all people, men and women.

##### *Strengths: Easy to Compare Different Variables; Easy to Interpret*

##### *Weakness: Difficult to Display Multiple Variables; Cannot Display Large Data on the x-axis*

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
lfs_sexage_raw = read.csv("/Users/anushadusakanti/Documents/GitHub/AnushaDusakanti15.github.io/LFS_SEXAGE_I_R_05032024021852784.csv")
unemployment_rate_japan = subset(lfs_sexage_raw, Country == 'Japan' & Age == '15 to 24' & Series == 'Unemployment rate')
unemployment_rate_japan = select(unemployment_rate_japan, Sex, Time, Value)
unemployment_rate_japan$Value = round(unemployment_rate_japan$Value, digits = 2)
unemployment_rate_japan <- unemployment_rate_japan %>% 
  rename(Year = Time)

row.names(unemployment_rate_japan) = NULL

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
data1993_2004 = subset(unemployment_rate_japan, Year >= 1993 & Year  <= 2004)
row.names(data1993_2004) = NULL
echo = FALSE
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyr))
transposed_1993_2004 = pivot_wider(data1993_2004, names_from = "Sex", values_from = "Value")
grouped_1993_2004 = transposed_1993_2004 %>%
  group_by(Year)
grouped_1993_2004 = grouped_1993_2004 %>% 
  rename(All.persons = 'All persons')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))

bar_plt_1993_2004 = plot_ly(grouped_1993_2004, x = ~Year, y = ~All.persons, type = 'bar', name = 'All persons',
             marker = list(color = 'green')) %>% 
    add_trace(y = ~Men, name = 'Men', 
              marker = list(color = 'blue')) %>%
    add_trace(y = ~Women, name = 'Women', 
              marker = list(color = 'red')) %>%
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Years", tickmode='linear', tickangle = -90),
           yaxis = list(title = "Youth Unemployment Rate (%)"),
           title = 'Youth Unemployment Rate during Ice Age \n Japan (1993-2004)',
            barmode = 'group')
bar_plt_1993_2004
```

#### **Visualization 2:** Multi-line plot of different genders, during the Employment Ice Age (1993-2004) in Japan

Our next redesign is a multi-line plot with facets, with each facet representing a different gender and each line representing a trend during Japan's Employment Ice Age (1993-2004). It is easy to see that the men's unemployment rate has steadily increased until 2003, whilst the women's unemployement rate has had short periods of decline.

##### *Strengths: Clearly distinguish between different genders; It displays trends over the years; It’s interactive*

##### *Weakness: Line overlap caused by too many data points per category may hide patterns, making it difficult to detect distinct trends.*

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
cc <- c("green","blue", "red")

graph <- ggplot(data1993_2004, aes(x = Year, y = Value, fill = Sex, group=1,
                                  text = paste("Sex:", Sex, "<br>Year:", Year, "<br>UR:", Value))) +
  geom_line(color="black") +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2.8) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Youth Unemployment Rate(%)", title = "Youth Unemployment Rate in Japan(1993-2004)") +
  facet_wrap(~ Sex) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cc) +
  labs(fill = "Population") +
  theme_grey() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1993, 2004, by = 3))

ggplotly(graph, tooltip = "text")
```

#### **Visualization 3:** Line Chart showing Relationship between GDP Growth Rate and Youth Unemployment Rate in Japan

From the line chart below, it looks like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate has slowed down over years and the negative percentage indicates the recession that Japan was hit with. Unemployment rate was initially under 5% until the early 1990s and the then it started increasing and eventually peaked in 2003 reaching almost 10.16%. After this the unemployment rate started decreasing at a steady rate.

##### *Strengths: Easy to understand trends; Easy to correlate*

##### *Weakness: Too much information can be overwhelming; Outliers can skew the data*

```{r echo = FALSE}
gdp_annual_1960 = read.csv("/Users/anushadusakanti/Documents/GitHub/AnushaDusakanti15.github.io/Japan_GDP_Annual_Growth.csv")
gdp_annual_1960 = select(gdp_annual_1960, Time, Value)
gdp_annual = slice(gdp_annual_1960, 9:63)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
gdp_annual$Time = as.numeric(gdp_annual$Time)
gdp_annual$Value = as.numeric(gdp_annual$Value)
gdp_annual$Value = round(gdp_annual$Value, digits = 2)
gdp_annual = gdp_annual %>% 
  rename(GDP_Annual_Growth = 'Value')
gdp_annual = gdp_annual %>% 
  rename(Year = 'Time')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
unemployment_all_persons = subset(unemployment_rate_japan, Sex == 'All persons')
unemployment_time_value = select(unemployment_all_persons, Year, Value)
unemployment_time_value = unemployment_time_value %>% 
  rename(Unemployment_Rate = 'Value')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
gdp_unemployment = merge(x = gdp_annual, y = unemployment_time_value, by = 'Year')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
line_gdp_unemp = plot_ly(gdp_unemployment, x = ~Year) %>% 
    add_trace(y = ~GDP_Annual_Growth, name = 'GDP Annual Growth (in Percentage)', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>% 
    add_trace(y = ~Unemployment_Rate, name = 'Youth Unemployment Rate (in Percentage)', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
    layout(xaxis = list(title = "Years", tickmode='linear', tickangle = -90),
           yaxis = list(title = "Percentage"),
           title = 'GDP Growth Rate vs Youth Unemployment Rate \n Japan (1968-2022)')
line_gdp_unemp
```

#### **Visualization 4:** World map with Youth Unemployment Rate of different countries in 2022

This last visualization depicts a world map showing the unemployment rates of various countries in 2022. We ranked the countries according to their unemployment rates and plotted them on a world map. The color legend ranges from red (Japan) representing the highest rated country to yellow (Greece), representing the lowest rated country.

##### *Strengths: Easy to identify the countries; Easy to compare rankings*

##### *Weakness: Trends for specific countries cannot be shown.*

```{r echo = FALSE}
countries_info = subset(lfs_sexage_raw, Age == "15 to 24" & Series == "Unemployment rate" & Time == "2022" & Sex == "All persons")

countries_info <- countries_info[order(countries_info$Value), ]

row.names(countries_info) = NULL

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressWarnings({
  color_scale <- colorRamp(c("red", "orange", "yellow"))
  
  min_value <- ifelse(length(countries_info$Value) > 0, min(countries_info$Value, na.rm = TRUE), NA)
  max_value <- ifelse(length(countries_info$Value) > 0, max(countries_info$Value, na.rm = TRUE), NA)

  rounded_ticks <- round(seq(min_value, max_value, length.out = 5), 2)
  
  fig <- plot_ly(countries_info,
                 type = "scattergeo",
                 mode = "markers",
                 locationmode = "country names",
                 locations = ~Country,
                 color = ~Value,
                 text = ~paste("Country: ", Country, "<br>UR: ", round(Value, 2)),
                 colors = color_scale,
                 marker = list(size = 10)) %>%
    layout(title = "Youth Unemployment Rate in 2022",
           geo = list(
             showframe = FALSE,
             projection = list(type = 'mercator'),
             bgcolor = "lightblue",
             showcoastlines = TRUE,
             showland = TRUE,
             landcolor = "lightgreen",
             showocean = TRUE,
             oceancolor = "lightblue"
           )) %>%
    colorbar(title = "Youth Unemployment Rate(%)",
             tickvals = seq(min_value, max_value, length.out = 5),
             ticktext = rounded_ticks)

  fig
})
```
